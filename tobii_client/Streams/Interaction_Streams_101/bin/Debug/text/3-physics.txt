The force that a gas exerts on a surface is due to collisions that the gas molecules make with that surface. For instance, think of the air inside an automobile tire. Whenever an air molecule collides with the inner tire surface, the tire exerts an inward force to turn the air molecule around and return it to the bulk of the gas. By Newtonâ€™s third law, the gas molecule exerts an outward force on the tire surface. The net force per unit area on the inside of the tire due to all the collisions of the many air molecules is equal to the air pressure in the tire.
