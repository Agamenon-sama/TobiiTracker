Some programs—in particular, many daemons—need to ensure that only one instance of the program is running on the system at a time. A common method of doing this is to have the daemon create a file in a standard directory and place a write lock on it. The daemon holds the file lock for the duration of its execution and deletes the file just before terminating. If another instance of the daemon is started, it will fail to obtain a write lock on the file. Consequently, it will realize that another instance of the daemon must already be running, and terminate.
